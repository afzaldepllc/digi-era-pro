and there should be proper search and navigation on that message works correctally just like in the whatsapp search for messages 
now this http://localhost:3000/api/communication/messages/search?channel_id=8d48bb5c-d5de-4f3f-9ff9-f056534456b6&query=dsasadsadsadsad&limit=50&offset=0
give this response

        "offset": 0,
        "query": "dsasadsadsadsad",
        "hasMore": false
    }
}

2) --not-resolved
whats the hell man why the realtime notification not working well again and again the issue explian bellow and resolve it professionally 

 In the channels list item and user_directory (dm channels for direct messages ) and in the message notification when read the messages than those notification clean but again seen/visible the same notifications  when refresh the page and than so on 
there should be proper implementation of this one and make sure every things should be working well without anu error
and make sure to handle the notification professionaly and corresctally when successfully read the notification than notification should be clean and there is the professional and proper implementation of the message read which should be completely realtime and every things should be working well and according to the current flow of this app 

now issue is that when when i open the channel in the reciver side and than send the message to this channel from sender side than the messages are not the realtime and not the message notification is not the  realtime at all now   when message send and now need refresh to show the notification in the reciever side but i want the completely realtime notification for all those channels which are not open yet or the user is not in the /communications route and all the other things are working well also as of now 
whats the hell man 
now again need refresh the page to show the notification but  i want the completely realtime message notification while all the other things should be wokring well and after read that notification clear out in well manner and every things should be working well without any error and every things should be according to current flow of this project and according to the best practices of supabase and every things should be implemented well and professionally 
and every things should be optimized and according to the current flow of this implementation



12) 
 the mention and reaction   feature should be handled in the professional way (now there are some issues with the both , in the reaction feature there should be proper mentioned user name and emoji used in the reaction) just like the whatsapp handle the mention user and make sure the mention feature can applied to all the channels other than one to one(with type "dm" or "client-support") channels  (with type dm and client-support) and reaction should also be working well and implemented well without any error and every things should be according to the flow of this app 

13) there should be proper role base permission for every action of the communication which should be dynamic 


16) channel setting and permission should be implemented well and handled in the professional way and there is not any issue and all the things shuld be working well according to the permissions and there is not any loading issues



19) there is the proper implementation of the synch member with the realtime experience  


21) for  the message auditlog, there should be proper separate ui proffessionaly 





6) --resolved-but-synch-issue now instead of leaving the channel the group admin can remove the any existing member with proper loges

make sure its working well 






9) -- almost-resolved there are some issue with the channel retriving in which there is no message yet and when refresh the page than sometime load all the  channels having messages or empty channels  but some time only channels load in which the messages are there and those where the  messages not conversation start mean channel with empty message are load with those channel lists and some time viceversa and these are with the channels with type !== dm 

 when refresh the page than there is no stability on the channels , some time all  channel of that login person not shown only one or twon channel seen when refresh the page so check whats the main issue behind it and resolve this one  and i want completely smoothness and working well and every things should be working well according to the current flow of this app and communication module 

and when i have open the channel and than refresh the page than all the channels closes but i want to open that channel which one is open before the refresh the page
