Multi-Layered Security Architecture Flow Diagram:

All Security Threats and its Solution
1️⃣ Weak Authentication / Password Storage
Threats: Plain text passwords, weak auth flows, single-factor admin logins, session fixation
Solutions: Strong auth with NextAuth.js, bcrypt hashing, JWT security, enforced 2FA for admins, account lockouts, secure session cookies (Redis-backed)

2️⃣ Unvalidated Input / API Abuse
Threats: SQL/NoSQL injection, code injection, API flooding, malformed requests
Solutions: Input validation (Zod, express-validator), sanitization, strict CORS, rate limiting, payload size limits

3️⃣ Device & Network Access Control
Threats: Unauthorized device access, external network infiltration, compromised personal devices
Solutions: IP whitelisting, VPN-only admin access, mTLS certificates, geolocation/IP reputation checks, device fingerprinting

4️⃣ Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) & Insecure Headers
Threats: Stored/reflected XSS, missing headers, clickjacking, content injection
Solutions: Strict CSP, security headers (X-Frame-Options, nosniff, Referrer-Policy), DOMPurify sanitization, nonce-based scripts

5️⃣ Broken Access Control / Authorization
Threats: Horizontal & vertical privilege escalation, bypass of RBAC, resource-level violations


Solutions: RBAC with inheritance, route-level middleware, department-level isolation, conditional permissions, approval workflows

6️⃣ Secrets Management & Environment Security
Threats: Hardcoded keys, env leaks, config drift, secrets in Git
Solutions: Encrypted env vars, environment segregation, secret rotation/scanning, secure key management (DB/API/JWT)



7️⃣ Data Security & Storage Protection
Threats: Breaches, insecure file storage, weak backups, insecure transmission
Solutions: Encryption at rest/in transit, TLS 1.3, encrypted file storage, PII masking, retention policies, prepared queries, access logging

8️⃣ Session Management & Token Security
Threats: Hijacking, replay attacks, weak session handling
Solutions: HTTPOnly + Secure cookies, SameSite=Strict, Redis session store, short-lived JWTs with refresh rotation, anomaly detection

9️⃣ Audit Trail & Compliance Logging
Threats: Missing or tampered logs, weak compliance visibility
Solutions: Write-only audit logging of CRUD + auth events, structured searchable logs, real-time admin monitoring, compliance-ready reports

🔟 Infrastructure & Deployment Security
Threats: CI/CD leaks, container vulnerabilities, config drift, supply chain risks


Solutions: Secure pipelines (Snyk, CodeQL), dependency pinning, IaC, environment isolation, container scanning, runtime monitoring

1️⃣1️⃣ Monitoring & Incident Response
Threats: Blind spots, delayed detection, poor recovery
Solutions: Centralized monitoring & alerts, backup + DR plans, incident playbooks, proactive response drills


Mobile Version Of CRM
Our primary/main focus is on Web-Based CRM, as it contains all functionality
But, there is another version of CRM, which is mobile-based, In Mobile-based CRM, we handle specific modules like client portal, and provide limited functionality to the users/client, as In mobile, it is not possible and recommended to provide all functionalities to the user/client.
CRM are usually Web-based, and in mobile-version we provide limited functionality and access to user/client.
Accessibility - If we want to provide mobile-based app to specific users, then we deploy it privately and provide its apk file or link to the user/client which have access to  the credentials.

1️⃣ Direct APK Distribution
Host your APK on your own website, Google Drive, Dropbox, or any server.


Users download and manually install the APK.


Users must enable “Install from Unknown Sources” (or “Allow this source”) on their devices.
Pros: Free, fast, full control.
 Cons: Less trust (users see warnings), harder to auto-update, no Play Protect scanning.

Questions for Understanding the Current flow
Business Understanding:
1. What is your primary business model and revenue streams?
Company’s primary business model is providing services like:
Development (Wordpress)
Graphics (Logo Design, Business Cards, Video Editing)
SEO (On Page + Off-Page)
Marketing (Yelp)
2. What are your current pain points in project management?
Communication
Monitoring
3. How many clients do you typically handle simultaneously?
10 - 15 (simultaneously)
4. What is your average project duration and complexity?
Depends on the Project, Usually (7 - 10) days
5. How do you currently measure project success?
By client’s feedback
By client’s retention period
Operational Requirements:
6. How many departments and team members will use this ?
Web - Wordpress Development
Graphics
SEO (On-Page + Off-Page)
 Sales
Support
GMB (Google Business Management)
Social Media
HR
Accounting
Quality Assurance(QA) -> will be added soon
7. What is your current project approval process?
Support Team assigns project to Team Lead / Team Manager
Team Lead / Team Manager assigns the project to Members
No, definite process right now
8. How do you handle client communications currently? And how many email sales agent/support managers/agents are used for communication with the multiple clients?
Client is hunted through Yelp
Sales Agent & Sales Closer makes deal with Sales Team
Then, client redirects to Support Team
Support Team, takes necessary details and requirements about the project.
9. What are your reporting and analytics needs? 
Different Graphs could be shown on CRM or Client Portal
On CRM, monitoring on employees
On Client Portal, monitoring on progress
10. Do you have any compliance or regulatory requirements?

Technical Considerations:
11. Do you need integration with existing tools?
If companies intra-communication would be on CRM, then it would be a great privilege.
12. What is your preferred deployment model (cloud/on-premise)?
Not really, it would be decided by Development Team.
13. What are your security and data privacy requirements?
Security is our crucial part and main concern. People other than clients and organization cannot use our Product.
14. Do you need mobile access for field teams?
No, only company’s systems should be use for CRM.
Future Planning:
16. What are your growth projections for the next 2-3 years?
17. Do you plan to expand to new markets or services?
Gradually, but not instantly.
19. How do you handle seasonal workload variations?
Seasonal workloads would be balanced, as there are more client demands one service, then other service is not in trending. So that’s why it would be balanced.
20. What is your disaster recovery and business continuity plan?

    read these files to understand the about the project complete flow and crud implementation flow with security and roles based permissions flow of this crm also 

    now i have implemented the role and permissions system with users,departments crud and i have initiated the real time communication(Chat module) also 
    so now i wanna to move on the preojects,leads and tasks (with sub tasks) project categorization, task assingment,when team member start on tasks and sub task than after completetion each task he update the status of that task after update the status of subtask of task so the task status also update automatically and when task status updated than also the status of that task's project also updated so the client can also track it project progress, and there is proper algorithm how to create the tasks of the project and than sub tasks of that task which should be ideal and easy for crm internal users like team member,team lead and manager and it should also easy to check and calculate the project progress 
    so in simple words every things should be covered using the current flow of this project in the ideal way in next js using the best practices of the next js and code should be generic and optimized and should follow the ideal/best approaches while all cover some other points which should be there in a professional and scalable crm ,


    so right now i just need the docs files which should explain each and every things how to develope this one in the module wise and step by step while firstally need to complete one things completely than move next with proper guidelines which should help to create the ideal and professional crm functionality so now just focus on the guidelines and using the current components and current flow
